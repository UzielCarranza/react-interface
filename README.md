An appointment manager web application build using Tailwind, React, and React Hooks. 
I coded along instructor Villanuevas to build this application.
It let me to learned and get started to build react components, debugging in React, etc. 
The main concepts that I learned was to pass data to components,
use the useState hook and conditional classes, toggle items by passing the state to a sub-component and using values to hide or show sub-components. 
The functionality of the application includes delete, search, and add appointments.
